## The original data set

A full description of the data is available at the site where it was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Variables in the tidy data set (`HAR-tidy.txt`)

Two variables are used to identify subjects and activities:
* Subject: identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. Integer from 1 to 30.
* Activity: activity performed by the subject. One of the six labels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

Other 66 variables are averages of the means and standard deviations from the original data set (their description can be found in `features_info.txt` included with the data set):

## Cleaning of the data set

* Subject IDs, activity codes and measurements were read from three different files and merged into one table.
* Activity codes were replaced with activity labels (for example, 1 with WALKING).
* Only columns we are interested in were extracted: subject, activity, means and standard deviations for different measurements.
* The training and the test data sets were merged.
* Averages of the selected measurements were computed by subject and activity.
